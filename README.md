## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set up API Keys (Optional Chatbot)

The application includes a collapsible AI chatbot that can answer questions about crops, soil, pests, and more. To enable this feature you need a Google Gemini API key.

1. Obtain a Gemini API key from Google Cloud.
2. Add the key to your environment or Streamlit secrets:

```bash
export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# or create .streamlit/secrets.toml:
# GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

If no key is provided the chatbot will remain disabled gracefully.

### Step 3: Verify Model Files

Make sure you have the following files in your project directory:
- `best_model.h5` - Your trained model
- `class_names.txt` - Class labels for the model

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
# Start the web application
python web_app.py
```

The application will be available at: **http://localhost:5000**

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser
2. **Upload Image**: 
   - Drag and drop a plant image onto the upload area, OR
   - Click "Choose Image" to browse and select a file
3. **Wait for Analysis**: The AI will process your image (usually takes 2-5 seconds)
4. **View Results**: 
   - See the disease detection results
   - Check confidence scores and health assessment
   - Read personalized recommendations
5. **Try Another Image**: Click "Analyze Another Image" to test more plants

## 🎯 Supported Image Formats

- **JPEG/JPG** - Most common format
- **PNG** - High quality images
- **GIF** - Animated or static images
- **BMP** - Bitmap images
- **TIFF** - High resolution images
- **WebP** - Modern web format

**Maximum file size**: 16MB

## 📊 Understanding Results

### Health Score
- **90-100%**: Excellent plant health
- **70-89%**: Good health with minor concerns
- **50-69%**: Moderate health issues
- **Below 50%**: Significant health problems

### Disease Probability
- Shows the likelihood of disease presence
- Higher percentages indicate more concerning conditions
- Healthy plants will show low disease probability

### Recommendations
The AI provides tailored advice such as:
- Treatment suggestions for detected diseases
- Prevention measures
- Monitoring recommendations
- When to consult agricultural experts

## 📦 Large Files (Hosted Externally)

Due to GitHub’s 100 MB file limit, large assets are hosted externally on Google Drive.

| File | Description | Download Link |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| `agriculture_dataset.csv` | Main agricultural dataset for Maharashtra | [Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gYrPlQFe9vJUA2lefT4t16u2Odka32Ze) |
| `fertilizer_prediction_model.pkl` | Trained fertilizer recommendation model | [Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ZNYqalYl1uATPF2g_bf9bgBcKtm2rbg8) |
| `maharashtra_agricultural_system_deployment.zip` | Deployment bundle | [Download](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10cOBdfiss9IFIKf9P90GvswUxz6ARBth) |

If your code needs these files at runtime (e.g., Streamlit app or model loading), add the helper below near the top of your main Python file (example `maharashtra_crop_system.py`):

```python
import os
import requests

def download_file(url, filename):
   if not os.path.exists(filename):
      print(f"Downloading {filename} ...")
      response = requests.get(url)
      with open(filename, "wb") as f:
         f.write(response.content)
      print(f"{filename} downloaded successfully.")
   else:
      print(f"{filename} already exists.")

# Automatically download files if missing
download_file(
   "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gYrPlQFe9vJUA2lefT4t16u2Odka32Ze",
   "maharashtra_agri_deployment/data/agriculture_dataset.csv",
)

download_file(
   "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ZNYqalYl1uATPF2g_bf9bgBcKtm2rbg8",
   "maharashtra_agri_deployment/models/fertilizer_prediction_model.pkl",
)
```

Note: I updated `maharashtra_crop_system.py` to prefer the downloaded model under `maharashtra_agri_deployment/models/` and to keep a backward-compatible copy in the project root (`fertilizer_prediction_model.pkl`). Make sure `requests` is installed in your environment before running the downloader.
